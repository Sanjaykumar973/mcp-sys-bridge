## Usage

Using the **MCP Sys Bridge** is straightforward. Below are some basic examples to help you get started.

### Clipboard Management

To interact with the clipboard, you can use the following methods:

#### Reading from Clipboard

```python
from mcp_sys_bridge import Clipboard

clipboard_content = Clipboard.get_text()
print("Clipboard contains:", clipboard_content)
```

#### Writing to Clipboard

```python
from mcp_sys_bridge import Clipboard

Clipboard.set_text("Hello, World!")
print("Text has been copied to clipboard.")
```

### URL Handling

To open a URL in the default web browser:

```python
from mcp_sys_bridge import URLHandler

URLHandler.open("https://www.example.com")
print("Opening URL in the default browser.")
```

### Automation Example

You can create scripts to automate tasks. Hereâ€™s a simple example that reads the clipboard and opens a URL:

```python
from mcp_sys_bridge import Clipboard, URLHandler

url = Clipboard.get_text()
if url.startswith("http"):
    URLHandler.open(url)
    print("Opened URL from clipboard.")
else:
    print("Clipboard does not contain a valid URL.")
```
